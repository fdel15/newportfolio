Single page web app created with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and jQuery.

I wanted to redo my personal website [frankd.co](www.frankd.co) as a single page web app. The page is fully responsive and displays nicely on mobile phones, tablets, and desktop. This project was a great way for me to brush up on my Bootstrap and jQuery skills.
